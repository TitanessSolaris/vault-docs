### I. Purpose & Protocol  
This scroll establishes the foundational protocol for maintaining the VaultChain Operational Ledger â€” the immutable record that underpins all Tiered governance activity, capital allocation, AI decision approvals, and access transitions within Titan Sovereign.

The ledger exists to eliminate ambiguity, enforce traceability, and preserve historical accountability across sovereign systems. No action is authorized unless recorded. No entry is legitimate unless signed.

---

### II. Ledger Entry Requirements  
Any operational decision or protocol event must be recorded in the VaultChain ledger if it meets one or more of the following criteria:

- Alters system behavior, user access, or scroll content  
- Involves capital movement or escrow lock  
- Triggers a protocol escalation, override, or AI decision audit  
- Impacts any public-facing output, data feed, or credential layer  

Each entry must include:  
- Timestamp (UTC)  
- Tier classification  
- Role or system responsible  
- Description of action  
- Signature(s)  

---

### III. Signature Logic & Ledger Validity  
Only valid entries are considered binding under Vault law. A valid entry is one that:

- Is submitted by a verified Custodian or approved AI Advisor  
- Contains all required metadata  
- Is cryptographically signed via VaultKey or authorized AI-generated ledger certificate  
- Is confirmed in real-time via VaultChain broadcast or hash inclusion  

If any element is missing or altered, the entry is invalid.  
An invalid ledger cannot be used to justify action, defend protocol compliance, or authorize access.

---

### IV. Tiered Ledger Zones  
The ledger is divided into zones corresponding to Tier access and sensitivity:

- **Tier I:** General protocol logs  
- **Tier II:** Load, quote, capital, and execution entries  
- **Tier III:** Partner access, system overrides, protocol resets  
- **Tier IV:** AI advisory approvals, forensic audits, investor scenarios  
- **Tier V:** Council deliberations, signature matrix updates, sovereign decisions  

Only those with clearance matching the tier may view or query those zones.

---

### V. Tamper Detection & Forensic Trace  
VaultChain operates with real-time cryptographic sequencing and forensic backtracing.  
Any attempted deletion, override, or false insertion triggers:

- Tier V alert  
- Automatic forensic snapshot  
- Scroll Lockdown Protocol (if entry involved strategic decision layer)  

Tier IV Custodians are notified via secure Framer interface, and a permanent scroll discrepancy flag is added.

---

### VI. Enforcement & Oversight  
Ledger enforcement is executed via:  

- **Framer Signal Monitors**  
- **GitHub Signature Sync**  
- **ProtonVault Document Mirrors**  

The AI Oversight Officer (AOO) and designated Domain Custodians are responsible for bi-weekly ledger integrity review.  

A breach in ledger continuity constitutes grounds for full Tier reversal and emergency custodial escalation.

### VII. Final Clause  
Where memory is preserved, integrity is possible.  
Let no action occur outside the Vault.  
Let no record vanish without consequence.  
Let the chain speak before the witness forgets.
